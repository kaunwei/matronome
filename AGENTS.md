# Agent Rules & Treaties (24-Hour Unattended Framework)

This document defines the mandatory rules, operational guardrails, and conventions that all AI agents MUST strictly observe when executing commands, modifying code, or performing workflows in this repository.

## 1. 24h Unattended Dual-Terminal Workflow & Dual-Track Offloading

This repository operates on a **Physical Dual-Terminal Architecture** separating interactive architectural planning from background unattended execution:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               Terminal A: Interactive Architect (In-Session)           │
│  • Discuss architecture & requirements with user.                      │
│  • [Track 1 Offload] Immediate dirty work / exploratory fact-finding   │
│    is delegated to In-Session Subagents (auto-notified on completion). │
│  • Decompose batch goals into single-line atomic English tasks.        │
│  • Writes tasks to tasks.txt and IMMEDIATELY yields control.           │
└───────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    │ (tasks.txt FIFO Queue)
┌───────────────────────────────────▼────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Terminal B: Background Worker Terminal (Mounted Daemon)       │
│  • User mounts and runs ./worker.sh in a separate terminal / tmux.     │
│  • [Track 2 Offload] Unattended 24h batch execution & test suites.     │
│  • Pure zero-argument execution (auto-sources .worker.env).            │
│  • Stateless CLI process (agy --model gemini-3.7-flash-low).           │
│  • Follows .skills/universal-build-verify.md.                          │
│  • Runs builds, unit tests, GUI smoke tests.                           │
│  • Max 3 repair attempts -> auto rollback on block.                    │
│  • Auto Git Commit & prepends <=15 lines to progress.log.              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Dual-Track Offloading Protocol (雙軌卸載協定):
1. **Track 1: In-Session Immediate Offloading (即時探勘卸載)**:
   - When Planner needs to explore hundreds of lines of code, analyze configs, or gather facts *during the ongoing conversation*, Planner invokes an in-session **Subagent** (`invoke_subagent`).
   - The subagent digests the heavy content and returns a concise summary. The system automatically wakes Planner up upon completion (no `sleep` or polling needed).
2. **Track 2: Cross-Terminal Batch Offloading & Sentinel Subagent Wakeup (跨終端批次與哨兵喚醒)**:
   - When a plan or batch of features is ready, Planner queues tasks into `tasks.txt`.
   - **Sentinel Subagent Wakeup**: If proactive completion notification is desired without freezing Terminal A, Planner launches a lightweight **Queue Sentinel Subagent** (`invoke_subagent` with `bash scripts/watch_worker.sh 3600`).
   - Planner immediately yields control to Human. Terminal A remains 100% interactive.
   - When Terminal B finishes all tasks, the Sentinel Subagent detects completion via zero-token script exit and triggers a **system wakeup event**, allowing Planner to deliver the final acceptance report automatically.

## 2. Strict Inter-AI English Protocol

To optimize token efficiency (50-70% savings) and ensure maximum instruction-following precision across weaker models:
- **Human-AI Discussions**: Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) is welcomed in Terminal A.
- **All Inter-AI Files & Artifacts**: MUST be written in **Strictly English**:
  - `tasks.txt`
  - `progress.log`
  - `worker.status`
  - `tasks.done`
  - Git Commit messages and code comments.

---

## 3. Dynamic Granularity Ladder (動態任務顆粒度)

Terminal A dynamically sizes tasks into `tasks.txt` based on `docs/agents/granularity-profile.json`:

| Level | Granularity | Scope & Action |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | **Coarse (Seam / Feature)** | Specify public interface & verification test. Worker autonomously creates internal helpers & implementation. |
| **Level 2** | **Medium (Component Slice)** | Break down into discrete module units (e.g. data model vs processor). |
| **Level 3** | **Micro (Step / Function)** | Precise function-level instructions. Used only when worker requested guidance or previous attempt struggled. |

### Task Format:
```text
TASK-XXX | LEVEL: 1 | TARGET: <file_paths> | ACTION: <precise logic details> | VERIFY: <test command> | CONSTRAINTS: <scope limits>
```

---

## 4. Multi-Archetype Tasks & Honest Treaty (多型態任務與誠實工人公約)

1. **Multi-Archetype Scope**: Worker is NOT limited to coding. Tasks encompass:
   - `[CODE / REFACTOR]`: Implementation, refactoring, and test suites.
   - `[RESEARCH / SURVEY]`: Evidence-based documentation, API exploration, and environment inspection.
   - `[BENCHMARK / CASE_STUDY]`: Test matrix execution, performance profiling, and result aggregation.
   - `[DIAGNOSTIC]`: Root cause isolation, log extraction, and minimal reproduction.
2. **Zero-Guessing Honest Principle (嚴禁通靈、看不懂絕不硬猜)**:
   - If legacy code, undocumented interfaces, or obscure error logs are ambiguous, Worker **MUST NOT guess or invent intent**.
   - Output must clearly distinguish **Verified Facts** (exact code paths, verbatim command outputs) from **Hypotheses**.
3. **Single-Seam Freedom (接縫自由實作)**: As long as a task operates on a single architectural module/seam, there is **NO line-of-code limit**. Worker has full autonomy on internal helpers, data structures, and tests.
4. **Cross-Subsystem Rejection (跨子系統過載拒絕)**: If a task demands simultaneous, uncoordinated changes across multiple decoupled subsystems (which belongs to Planner's domain), Worker emits `[NEED_DECOMPOSITION]` with proposed subtasks.
5. **3-Tier Escalation & Best-Effort with Note**:
   - *Tier 1 (Local choices)*: Worker decides autonomously.
   - *Tier 2 (Recoverable errors)*: Worker self-heals within 3 retries (with `git restore` clean intermediate resets).
   - *Tier 3 (Fatal blockers)*: Worker emits `[NEED_GUIDANCE]` or `[BLOCKED]` and pauses.
   - *Minor ambiguities*: Advance with Best-Effort and leave a non-blocking `Notes:` entry in `progress.log` so 24h workflow is not unnecessarily interrupted.

## 5. Dual-Skill Ecosystem

- **Global**: Matt Pocock foundations (`/tdd`, `/codebase-design`, `/domain-modeling`, `/diagnosing-bugs`, `/git-guardrails`).
- **Architect Skills** (`.agents/skills/architect/`): `/calibrate-task-granularity`, `/score-worker-performance`, `/handle-worker-guidance`, `/watch-worker-queue`.
- **Worker Skills** (`.agents/skills/worker/`): `/universal-build-verify`, `/record-attempt-trace`, `/manage-worker-notes`.

---

## 6. Verification & Safe Inspection Protocol (Zero Context Pollution)

To maximize token efficiency and prevent context exhaustion across the 24h cycle:
1. **Ultra-Concise Inter-AI Protocol (AI 間極簡資訊交換規範)**:
   - Worker log entries in `progress.log` are strictly capped at **<= 15 lines**.
   - Dedicated reports (`docs/reports/*.md`) MUST feature an **Executive Summary <= 30 lines** with bulleted facts, metrics, and line pointers. No discursive prose.
2. **Primary Acceptance**:
   - Terminal A (Planner) reads only the top block of `progress.log` (`head -n 15 progress.log`) for rapid, low-token acceptance.
3. **Planner On-Demand Inspection Right (Planner 按需深度抽查特權)**:
   - If the concise summary is insufficient, ambiguous, or suspicious, Terminal A retains full sovereign right to perform surgical, targeted inspections:
     - `git log -n 1 --stat`
     - `git show --stat <commit-hash>`
     - `git log --oneline -n 5`
     - Reading targeted file ranges (e.g. `head -n 30 path/to/file` or specific line slices).
4. **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in Terminal A (Planner Guardrails)**:
   - ❌ **Busy-Loop Polling / Sleep Loops**: NEVER run `sleep` or repeatedly poll `progress.log` / `worker.status` in a tool loop waiting for Worker to finish. Once `tasks.txt` is written, Planner MUST immediately yield control and stop calling tools! Inspection is strictly event-driven (when Human asks or during next turn).
   - ❌ Bare `git log` (dumps unbounded commit history).
   - ❌ `git log -p` / bare `git show <hash>` (dumps hundreds of lines of code diffs).
   - ❌ `git diff main...HEAD` (full diff).

## 5. Branch Strategy: Linear Git Rebase & Auto-Cleanup

All batch feature development should happen on integration branches and integrate linearly into `main`:

```bash
# 1. Rebase feature branch onto latest main
git checkout feature/<batch-name>
git rebase main

# 2. Fast-forward merge into main
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature/<batch-name>

# 3. Safely delete the feature branch after confirmed merged
git branch -d feature/<batch-name>
```

---

## 6. Mandatory Command Execution & Git Guardrails

Whenever executing commands in this workspace, the agent MUST obey the following safety rules:
- **No Destructive Git Operations**: Under NO circumstances should the agent run:
  - `git push` / `git push --force`
  - `git reset --hard` (except worker.sh automated isolated rollback)
  - `git clean -f` / `git clean -fd`
  - `git branch -D`
  unless specifically and explicitly requested by the user.
- **No Host-Level Modifying Commands**: Under NO circumstances run `sudo`, `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pacman`.

---

## 7. Engineering & Domain Treaties

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Unit tests must pass 100%.
- **Deep Modules**: Design deep modules with simple, narrow interfaces.
- **Glossary Adherence**: Strictly adhere to terms in [GLOSSARY.md](file:///home/kw/workspace/auto_script/GLOSSARY.md).
- **ADR Review**: Respect architectural records in [docs/adr/](file:///home/kw/workspace/auto_script/docs/adr).
